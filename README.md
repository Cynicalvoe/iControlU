# iControlU
A Minecraft plugin that adds mind control to your Spigot server.

## About
This plugin was originally a Premium resource of mine on Spigot. However, after losing interest in Minecraft server modding, I decided to publish the source code for free.

## Current Status
The plugin has gone through a large number of revisions over the years, particularly because I was learning Java at the same time. As such, the code is not pretty, and although the
plugin can compile, it encounters runtime issues on the latest version of Minecraft. I've posted releases of past versions of the plugin so that it can continue to bring enjoyment
to players, however future versions are not guaranteed.

**However**, if you would like to contribute to the plugin's future, I welcome any and all contributions. Of particular note, I'd love it for this plugin to fully work on the latest
version of the game.
